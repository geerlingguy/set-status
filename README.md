# Set Status - Chat Status Management AppleScripts

These are some simple AppleScript-based apps which allow me to set my status across both Skype and Adium by opening Alfred or Spotlight, typing "away", "offline", or "back", and pressing return.

It's annoying to have to go into both apps and click the little status icons to switch... plus, I would never remember to do both apps, so some people thought I was at my Mac when I was not, and others thought I was away or offline when I was sitting here contentedly.

Thus, these three ridiculously-simple apps. They take a few ms to launch and run, and they quit on their own when they're finished with their dirty work.
